- When a URL is entered in a browser and requested or pressed enter it requests to the server that host the website and proceeds with providing response back to the client in form of response.
- This Transferring happens with the help of [HTTP or Hypertext Transfer Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol).
- As the each whenever a page is requested and the server provide response of the certain page.
- The page transferred through HTTP is filled with some code they are called [HTML or Hypertext Markup Language](https://www.w3schools.com/html/).
- Normally as server returns HTML page from the server as the scalability can be inefficient compared to server sharing the important data's and client generating the HTML Webpage.
- Some apps that allow to generate webpage around the client are React,Angular and Vue.
- Backend apps that generate webpage are Django , ASP.NET Core, Express.
- Server provides a [API or Application Programming Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) that allow user to get conneceted with the backend or server.
