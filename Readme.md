# Learnings
I have created this for making my own apps from watching tutorials from Youtube and articles

I have done alot of learnings before but I haven't recorded anything as I think this could be helpful in my future if I need to refer any of my learning,

I will try to reduce leaking my personal things like API's in most case because I don't want it destroyed.
